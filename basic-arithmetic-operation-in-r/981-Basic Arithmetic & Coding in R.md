## Comments in R

* When writing code in R, it’s important to make sure that your code can be easily understood by others, say by your friend who wants to see your code. This can be done with a comment. Comments can be specified to explain what your code does.
* R ignores everything after the hash mark and up to the end of the line. You can insert them anywhere in your code!

## Operators in R

* Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
* Some of the operators that R supports are listed below:
  * Arithmetic operators
  * Comparison operators
  * Assignment operators
  * Logical operators
* Let’s see some of the well know operators.

### Arithmetic Operator

* Used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations.
* The addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. operations come under this category.
* Example:  
x = 2  
y = 3  
x + y # Addition  
x \* y # Multiplication

### Comparison Operator

* Used to compare two values
* Gives a boolean result (True/False)

## Variables

* A variable can be considered a storage container for data.
* Every variable will have a name.
* It is a good way to store information while making it easy to refer to that information in our code later.

* For instance, instead of working with the number 3.14, we can assign it to a variable pi and use it as many times as we want later.
* The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.
* The syntax for assigning values to a variable is as follows: Variable name = value or information
* Example:  
x = 5  
y = "John"
* In the video coming up, the tutor will discuss following things in the hands on tutorial:
  * How to assign values to object is R using the equal sign (=) or less than sign with dash
  * How to use ls function to see the data stored in R
  * How to use rm function to remove an object in R
  * How to add, subtract, multiply, and divide in R
  * How to use sqrt function in R to find the square root of an object
  * How to use log function in R to calculate logarithms
  * How to use exp function in R to take the exponent or anti-log
  * How to use abs function in R to calculate the absolute value
  * and a few handy keyboard shortcuts in R
