## Learning Objectives

* Basic Functions to check data in R
* Working with Variables

### Dataset

We will be using the Lung patient dataset. You can download the dataset from the given links:

* [Tab Delimited Text File (CSV)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12bmZ5M2YQE\_4KrQQ\_3ILFvcDaSHqbH\_2/view?usp=sharing)
* [Excel File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bIReYPxxxrDTzJqJnUY5JV2z-51-apVB/view?usp=sharing)

## Basic Functions to Check Data in R

### head( )

* Once you have loaded (or imported) data in R, we can check how our data looks.

* We can take a look at the first six observations of the data using the head() function in R. See the screenshot below

### tail( )

* We can take a look at the last six observations of the data using the tail() function in R. See the screenshot below

### Checking Particular Records

* We can use the concatenate function ( i.e. c( ) ) to select some random records.

### Try Yourself!

If you remember from the earlier lesson, we used colon ( : ) to generate a sequence. Use this to display some data.

### Solution to Previous Problem

### Display the Column Names of the Data

* We can use the names() function to display the column names of the data. See the screenshot below

## Working With Variables

### Selecting A Single Column from Data

To select a single variable or column from the dataset, we use **$**. For example,

LungCapData$Age







![image.png](https://dphi-live.s3.amazonaws.com/media_uploads/image_bdc13e5bc325481da2ba751d4ef32a61.png)




These are the ages of the patients.

### Mean of a Variable

We can use the mean() function to calculate the mean of the data points of a variable.

mean(LungCapData$Age)

If you access the column directly, it will throw an error.

### Summary of the Dataset

To get the statistical summary of the data, we can use the summary() function in R.

summary(LungCapData)

You can see the summary of **numerical variables** including minimum value (min), quantiles, mean, etc. In contrast, **categorical** (or **character** or **factor**) variables include total data points count, their class, and mode.

* In the video coming up in the next slide, the tutor will discuss the following things in the hands-on tutorial:

  ▶︎ How to check variable names for datasets in R?

  ▶︎ How to extract a variable from a dataset in R?

  ▶︎ How to check the variable type (numeric or categorical) in R?

  ▶︎ How to ask R for different levels/categories of a categorical variable?

  ▶︎ How to produce a summary for variable in R? Summary function in R will produce a summary of variables based on their type, for example, numeric values will be summarized by mean, median, and quartiles and factors or categorical variables will be summarized as frequencies.
