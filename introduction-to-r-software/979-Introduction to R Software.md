## Learning Objectives

* Why is R important for Data Science?
* What is R?
* Why the name R?
* Why Learn R? 
* R Vs. Python




## What is R?

* R is a programming language and an environment for statistical computing and graphics.
* It compiles and runs on various UNIX platforms, Windows, and macOS.
* It provides various statistical (linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.) and graphical techniques.
* It is highly extensible.
* It is an easy-to-learn language.





## Why the Name R?

* This programming language was named **R**, based on the **first letter** of the first name of the two **R authors** (Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka), and partly a play on the name of the Bell Labs Language **S**.
* S is another statistical programming language that was designed at Bell Laboratory.




## Why Learn R?

* It is a free and open source tool
* It has become one of the most popular programming languages in the industry.
* It has a large community of users
* It is independent of the platform
* It is the gateway to a lucrative (profit-making) career
* It is used in almost every industry
* Well, not motivated why you should start learning R? Go through this short article: https://data-flair.training/blogs/why-learn-r/





## Why is R Important for Data Science?

* R plays a vital role in data science. You will benefit from the following operations in R:
  * **You can run your code without any compiler –** R is an interpreted language. Hence we can run code without any compiler. R interprets the code and makes the development of code easier.
  * **Many calculations done with vectors –** R is a vector language, so anyone can add functions to a single Vector without putting it in a loop. Hence, R is powerful and faster than other languages.
  * **Statistical Language –** R used in biology, genetics, and statistics. R is becoming a complete language where any task can be performed.





## R Vs. Python: Which One to Choose for Data Science?

* **R** was built as a statistical language. It suits much better to do statistical learning with R. It represents how statisticians think pretty well, so anyone with a formal statistics background can use R easily.
* **Python**, on the other hand, is a better choice for machine learning with its flexibility for production use, especially when the data analysis tasks need to be integrated with web applications.
* **R** and **Python** are state of the art in terms of programming languages oriented towards data science. Learning both of them is, of course, the ideal solution.
