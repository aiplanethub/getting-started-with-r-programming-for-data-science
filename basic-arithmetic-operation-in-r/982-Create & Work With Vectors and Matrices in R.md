## Learning Objectives

* Creating Vectors
* Creating Matrices
* Performing Some Simple Operations on Vectors & Matrices

## Vector

* A vector, in programming, is a type of array that is one-dimensional.
* **Now, what are dimensions?** - Let’s take an example of a box to explain this. A box has three dimensions width, length, and depth (or height). Similarly, we work with “N” dimensional datasets in data science. “N” could be any number.

## Matrix

* Matrix is an arrangement of numbers into rows and columns

## Creating Vector in R

* We can create a vector in R using the c or concatenate command in R.
* See the example below:

## Creating Sequence in R

* We can generate sequence of numbers in R as shown below:

* In the video coming up in the next slide, the tutor will discuss following things in the hands on tutorial:

  ▶︎ How to create vectors in R for numbers or objects using the c function or concatenate function

  ▶︎ How to use seq function to create sequence data in R

  ▶︎ How to use rep function in R to create a vector of repeated numbers or characters

  ▶︎ How to create a matrix using matrix function in R and use square brackets to extract certain elements from a matrix in R

  ▶︎ How to perform basic arithmetic functions on the elements of one vector, perform arithmetic functions on the corresponding elements of two vectors and perform element-wise arithmetic 
functions in a matrix in R Statistical software.
